![Generative UI with LangChain Python](./frontend/public/gen_ui_diagram.png)

## Overview (Python LangGraph FireCrawl üî• Tool)

This application aims to provide a template for building generative UI applications with LangChain Python.
It comes pre-built with a few UI features which you can use to play about with gen ui. The UI components are built using [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gitmaxd/gen-ui-firecrawl-python.git

cd gen-ui-firecrawl-python
```

Install dependencies in the `frontend` and `backend` directories:

```bash
cd ./frontend

yarn install
```

```bash
cd ../backend

poetry install
```

### Secrets

Next, if you plan on using the existing pre-built UI components, you'll need to set a few environment variables:

Copy the [`.env.example`](./backend/.env.example) file to `.env` inside the `backend` directory.

LangSmith keys are optional, but highly recommended if you plan on developing this application further.

The `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required. Get your OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/login?launch).

[Sign up/in to LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) and get your API key.

Create a new [GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `repo` scope.

[Create a free Geocode account](https://geocode.xyz/api).

The `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is required for web based data extraction (this demo). Get your FireCrawl API key and 500 free credits from the [FireCrawl dashboard](https://www.firecrawl.dev/account).
```bash
# ------------------LangSmith tracing------------------
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=...
LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
# -----------------------------------------------------

GITHUB_TOKEN=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GEOCODE_API_KEY=...
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=...
```

### Running the Application

```bash
cd ./frontend

yarn dev
```

This will start a development server on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

Then, in a new terminal window:

```bash
cd ../backend

poetry run start
```

### Go further

If you're interested in ways to take this demo application further, I'd consider the following:

Generating entire React components to be rendered, instead of relying on pre-built components. OR: Using the LLM to build custom components using a UI library like [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
Multi-tool and component usage. Update the LangGraph agent to call multiple tools, and appending multiple different UI components to the client rendered UI.
Generative UI outside of the chatbot window. Have the UI dynamically render in different areas on the screen. E.g a dashboard, where the components are dynamically rendered based on the LLMs output.
